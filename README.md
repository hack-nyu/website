The stylesheets use [Sass (.scss)](http://sass-lang.com/), which is a
CSS preprocessor. This allows us to use modules, variables, and
several other improvements. It's syntax is very similar to CSS:
http://sass-lang.com/guide. The primary file is `style.scss`, which is
compiled into the `style.css` file. `cd` into `stylesheets/` and run:

```
sass --watch style.scss:style.css
```
